## Goals of this project

The goal of this project is to make complex and obtuse information about the game Lost Ark available to Lost Ark players in a way that is concise and easy to understand.

## How goals are set

This app was initally build to solve a single, simple problem, but has expanded considerably over time. Almost all changes and new features have been added thanks to user feedback and suggestions. The main process, in terms of building an app that our community will like, and want to use, is requesting and listening to user feedback.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to make a suggestion, or create a pull request and add your own work to the project, please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/x82dcfNcjw). This is where all discussion and planning for the project takes place.
